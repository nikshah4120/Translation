# How it works?
As you run main.js script it will output all those labels which aren't translated in all languages(i.e If label is not translated in all language) in output_en_US.json file

merge.js file will merge newly translated labels to  already translated labels
you have to keep all newly translated label files in merge folder and already translated labels to translations file

mergegenerator.js file is generating sample newly translated labels

jsongenerator.js file is generating sample already translated labels
